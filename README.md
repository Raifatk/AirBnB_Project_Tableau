## Project Description

In this project, I analyzed Airbnb listings data from a specific city to explore trends, pricing strategies, occupancy rates, and geographical distribution of listings. The analysis is visualized using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into the best time and region to start an Airbnb business.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). It includes information about listings, hosts, geographical locations, prices, and availability.

## Objectives

- To analyze the distribution and density of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods.
- To identify the best time of the year to start an Airbnb business based on occupancy rates.
- To understand pricing trends and identify factors influencing pricing.
- To provide actionable insights for hosts to optimize their listings.

## Data Preprocessing

Before importing the data into Tableau, I performed the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant columns.
   - Handled missing values by using appropriate imputation techniques.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Created new columns.
   - Converted data types to ensure compatibility with Tableau.
